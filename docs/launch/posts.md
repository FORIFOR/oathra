## Hacker News — Show HN

**Title**: Show HN: Oathra – give AI agents a phone, and proof of what happened

**Text**:

Oathra is an open-source (Apache-2.0) runtime for AI agents that make phone calls: call a restaurant, negotiate, book, and return a result you can trust.

The part we care most about is the "trust" part. The result is not an LLM summary. Every field (date, time, party size, price, "confirmed") is anchored to an utterance from the *other* party, and completion is decided by code — never by asking the model whether it succeeded. Refusals ("19:00 is full, but 19:30 works") never become offers; corrections supersede; hedges ("probably fine") do not confirm; a confirmation goes stale if the deal changes after it was spoken. We fuzz this with 10,000 mutated simulated callees (never-confirm, wrong restate, negate-then-offer, silent hangup, echo trap) and the count of false completions is 0.

`npx oathra demo` opens a small "arena" where two agents negotiate in your browser with no API key (there is a play mode where you answer the phone yourself). The same runtime drives real calls: Twilio direct media streams, or any SIP trunk (Plivo, custom) through a LiveKit gateway. The voice engine is separate: GPT-Live (full-duplex) was the most natural on our test calls, so it is the default; there is also an OpenAI Realtime engine and a Deepgram + LLM + TTS pipeline.

What is verified today: Twilio calls to a Japanese mobile, a 6-minute GPT-Live call, the evidence engine (0/10,000). What is not: Plivo/custom SIP over PSTN (implemented from provider docs), Telnyx/others, MCP.

Happy to answer anything about the evidence rules, the phone layer, or the latency numbers.

1/ We gave AI agents a phone — and made them prove what happened.

Oathra: open-source runtime for agents that call, negotiate, book. The result is evidence, not a summary.

npx oathra demo → two agents haggle in your browser, no API key.

2/ "予約できました" is not evidence.

Every field is anchored to the other party's words. Completion is decided by code. 10,000 mutated callees, 0 false completions.

3/ Bring your own carrier. Bring your own model.

Twilio direct · Plivo / custom SIP via LiveKit
GPT-Live (recommended) · OpenAI Realtime · Deepgram+LLM+TTS

`oathra setup phone` — 2–3 questions, guided steps for anything a human must do. `oathra phone doctor` tells you which layer is broken.

4/ Battle your models on "Impossible Hotel". Both GPT-4o-mini and Gemini Flash walked away above budget — and neither claimed success. That's the point.

## X / Twitter (JA)

AIエージェントに電話を持たせて、しかも「本当に予約できたか」を証明させる OSS を公開しました。

Oathra — 結果は LLM の要約ではなく、相手の発言に紐づいた証拠付きの構造化データです。完了判定はコードが行い、10,000 通りの意地悪な店員シミュレーションで False Completion は 0。

npx oathra demo で API キー無しに AI 同士の交渉を見られます。
Twilio / Plivo / 自前 SIP × GPT-Live / Realtime / パイプライン、好きに組み合わせられます。

## Reddit — r/LocalLLaMA, r/artificial, r/programming

**Title**: Oathra: open-source runtime for AI agents that make phone calls — with verified results (0/10,000 false completions in adversarial sim)

Body: (use the HN text; add) Ollama brains are supported in the pipeline engine; the simulator and the evidence engine run fully offline.

## Product Hunt / dev.to (later)

Headline: Give AI agents a phone — and proof of what happened.
Tagline: Playable simulator · real calls · verified outcomes · bring your own carrier & model.
